Tagaini Jisho, version 0.2.5
============================

This is Tagaini Jisho, a free software Japanese dictionary and learning 
assistant.

About
-----
Tagaini Jisho is designed to help you remember Japanese vocabulary and kanjis
(later referred as 'entries') by presenting them in a way that makes it easy to
create connections between them. It does so by keeping track of all the entries you
already know and want to study, and letting you tag and annote them, in addition to
providing easy navigation between related entries. A powerful search engine also allows
you to search for entries very precisely. Finally, Tagaini let you produce printed 
material (including a handy foldable pocket book) so let you study anywhere.

Tagaini Jisho runs on Linux/Unix, MacOS X, and Microsoft Windows.

Features
--------
- Japanese dictionary based on JMdict.
- Kanji dictionary based on kanjidic2 and KanjiVG.
- Powerful search engine with many search parameters: JLPT level, part-of-speech, etc.
- Entries can be marked for study and have a score that evolves as you correctly
  recognize them.
- Training mode for studied entries, where lowest score entries are more likely to be
  trained.
- Lists based on your training history. Get a convenient list of all the entries you
  mistaken today, yesterday or this week! 
- Tagging of entries.
- Annotation of entries.
- Print feature with connections between studied kanjis and vocabulary, in a format
  that allows both studying and flash-carding (thumb-hideable Japanese part).

Compiling
---------
The only runtime dependency to run Tagaini Jisho is Qt 4.5 or higher. In order
to compile it, you will also need CMake 2.8 or higher.

Compilation requires two steps: first, the program is compiled, and second,
the dictionaries it uses are created.

To compile the program, you first need to invoke cmake in order to generate
Makefiles for your platform:

$ cmake .

Unix users: by default, the program will be installed into /usr/local. You can
change this by setting the INSTALL_PREFIX variable when invoking qmake:

$ cmake INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir .

Compilation may be performed. On Unix systems, invoking make will be
enough:

$ make

Finally, you can install the program to its destination:

# make install

Generating the databases is just a matter of invoking make again with a different
target:

$ make databases
